generating art with neural style transfer

Neural Style Transer consists of generating an image with the same content as the input image called the content image but with the style of another image called the style image as shown in the example below : 

| Content image  | style image | generated image |
| ------| -----------  | ----------|
|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/F28w3Ac.jpg" width="200" height="200" />|<img src="https://github.com/medardif123/Neural-Style-Transfer/blob/main/style.jpg" width="200" height="200" />|<img src="https://github.com/medardif123/Neural-Style-Transfer/blob/main/image_1000.jpg" width="200" height="200" />|

this result is generated after 1000 epochs.
